This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or

## Data Accuracy

Every effort is made to ensure data accuracy:
- All provision text is sourced from official government publications
- Zero AI-generated or summarized legal text
- Automated golden tests verify data integrity
- Daily freshness checks detect upstream changes

However, automated ingestion from HTML/API sources can introduce formatting
artifacts. When precision matters, cross-reference with the official source.
